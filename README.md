## Slack website clone exercise

This is a Brazilian Slack website clone.
The purpose of this clone is to enhance my new skills of using React and Tailwind.
In this website I tried my best to make this clone without seeing any of its original code and guessing about its properties.

### Stack that I'd used:
    - React
    - Tailwind
    - Jest
