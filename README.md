## Slack website clone exercise

This is a Brazilian Slack website clone.
The purpose of this clone is to enhance my new skills of using React and Tailwind.
In this website I tried my best to make this clone without seeing any of its original code and guessing about its properties.

## How to run:
    - fork your copy, and open at your preferable IDE.
    - run the "npm install" on your terminal in order to install all the dependencies needed
    - run the "npm run dev" to open a localhost.
  
## Checklist of main mechanics that I wished to achieve:

    [x] :: Learn how to work with NEXT.js (Folders Routing);
    [x] :: Learn how to work with JEST.js (Unitary tests);
    [x] :: Learn and get used to TailwindCSS Library;
    [x] :: Work with Translatable webpages using lang libraries (JSON);
    [x] :: Work with React to get used to Components and Hooks.
